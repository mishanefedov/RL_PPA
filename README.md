# RL_PPA Improvements

##### The main branch of this repository enhances RL-PPA with teleportation. 
##### The PDQN branch of this repository implements Parameterized DQN on stable_baselines3 (release 1.5.0) to improve sample efficiency.
##### CPP-GripperControl branch:
The original GripperControl module was implemented in python. The new CPP implementation computes A* search 10 times faster compared to the old implementation(on average).
TODO: add GripperControl teleportation in CPP
